A lot of information regarding the Vetiver System and how to use it can be found on [The Vetiver Network International (TVNI)](https://www.vetiver.org/) and throughout many helpful documents/presentations such as [**these**](https://www.vetiver.org/TVN_VS_GAL_HR%20/index.htm).

To help new small-scale growers in the subtropics, I have written some high-resolution pictorial guides on propagation and planting in addition to the above resources. These are guides based in SE QLD on decomposed granite soil with rainfall averaging 800mm-1.2m a year. They are intended to help you start your nursery and build your first hedges in any locale.

These guides can be found [**here**](/prop/) or directly as the [**Propagation Guide**](/assets/Vetiver Propagation subtropics.pdf) (10.3MB), the [**Planting Guide**](/assets/Vetiver Planting Guide.pdf) (17.7MB) or some answers to [**Frequently Asked Questions**](/assets/Vetiver FAQ.pdf).
