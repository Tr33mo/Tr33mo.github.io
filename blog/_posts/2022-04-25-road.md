A standard hedge that delineates road edge and revegetation area. Hedged occasionally with no special care.

Material is either thrown into reveg area, or placed on road edge side for filtering. In this case, it has gone into the reveg for mulch.

Not far away is a pioneering hedge that has done its job (which was silt control during planting) and is now beginning to be shaded out from the surrounding vegetation. Eventually given deep enough shade, the Vetiver could possibly thin out and die. If a fire hit this particular patch soon, the Vetiver would bounce back and start catching soil again while waiting for the canopy to be replaced. This is an example of moving back to a forested state while using Vetiver as an insurance policy for soil loss due to disturbance while plants establish.
