People often wonder how they can use Vetiver at their home when they don't have steep, eroding hills or dam bywashes or similar. Vetiver is a versatile plant that can create a lot of biomass in the right conditions and this can be used as an advantage for mulching gardens or creating animal bedding amongst other uses. Vetiver can also form a barrier to other grasses to prevent ingress into garden beds or just delineating garden edges for traffic.
