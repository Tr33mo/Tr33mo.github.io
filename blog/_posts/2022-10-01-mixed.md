Pictured here are hedges that I have used across our house site to reduce grass-mowing maintenance and to grow trees usually a year or two later. Using the biomass production of the Vetiver to mulch out and shade the surrounding pasture grasses as a pioneer, creates an ideal spot for tree planting. Visible here are Citrus, Eucalypt pollards (for short pole production/mulch), and Persimmon.
