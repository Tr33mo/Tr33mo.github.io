title: "Greywater with Vetiver Update"

Below is a approximately 2 week update between photos of the growth around the Vetiver greywater system. There has been little rainfall to this point besides during planting.

Note the larger growth on the outflow of the bathtub indicating irrigation can have a substantial effect on Vetiver.
