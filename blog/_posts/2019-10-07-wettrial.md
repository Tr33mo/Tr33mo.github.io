Autumn and Winter had heavy rainfall culminating in the late Summer growth being inundated for over 3 months. It's theorised here that long-term inundation may damage small tillers/shoots and possibly some of the crown. This results in dead centre sections of the crown during division and a larger number of single tillers/shoots that only have one growing point. The single tillers aren't recommended for planting out in the field (these are potted up in the nursery and planted out when they have 3+ growing shoots and good root development). TVNI recommends slips having at least 2-3 active tillers for higher survival rates and quicker hedge building.

Here is the propagation area in late April.

Some of the clumps were cut with a brushcutter close to ground level to see the extent of the dieback. This was done on 10th of September.

This is the growth 1 week later on the 17th of September.

10 days later (or 17 days from cutting) on the 27th September.

Now on the 7th of October. Still no significant rainfall. Some clumps have responded with tillering in centre but others have not. More time needed before conclusions can be made.

In between these shots, adjacent rows were cut at two different heights at approximately 20cm and 40cm. The tillers in the centre of the higher cuts may not be exposed enough to grow.
