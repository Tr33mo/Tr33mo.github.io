title: "Vetiver Plant and Roots Document"
---
Dr. Paul Truong of Queensland, Australia has kindly released a new book on the Vetiver plant focusing more on the roots. This book is extensive and scientific but with an excellent collection of photos from around the world. It clearly demonstrates why Vetiver is a superior plant physiologically to most others and should help readers understand how Vetiver could be integrated into a myriad of projects safely and with excellent results.

Native Plant enthusiasts within the conservation industry should take note, in a changing world, that some tools are better than others and will help you realise your "conservation" goals quicker.
