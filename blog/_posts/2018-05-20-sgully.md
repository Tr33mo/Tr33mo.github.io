Below is an example of a low-light (approximately 50-60%) gully erosion headcut repair using Vetiver, combined with a local sedge, *Lomandra hystrix*. Lomandra does well where Vetiver does not, but requires far more plants to be not nearly as effective as full sun Vetiver.

Here are the Vetiver roots visibly knitting the soil together on the headcut wall batter.
