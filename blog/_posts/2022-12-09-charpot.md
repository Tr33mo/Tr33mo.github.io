After 8 weeks, the [charpot](/blog/2022/10/08/charpot/) trial can be considered a mild success. A low-cost, renewable and sustainable media with no additives (other than animal manure and the feed to create it), enriched by said manure and ground contact. As lower quality slips were used, 1 didn't survive and a few are less than fully ready (single tiller growth only). The plants pictured are healthy enough and are ready to be transplanted.
