These rows of Vetiver have pioneered a grass area and have transitioned to a fruit tree planting and pollarded Eucalypts over time. As long as the shade over the Vetiver isn't too high, the Vetiver continues to provide mulch to the point of suppressing most weeds.

Most applications of the cut Vetiver are applied to the preexisting cut Vetiver. As the grass blade has small amounts of Vetiver oil, it is resistant to rot and lasts much longer than other grass mulches like sugar cane.
